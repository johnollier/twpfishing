            which is 2 kilometers downstream where a stone wall meets the river
            on the left bank. Fishing is from the left bank only.

            There is ample parking at the Four Winds car park, east of the
            Dartmoor Inn on the B3357. Opposite the car park a track leads to
            Little Mis Tor. At the end of the track walk west, downhill,
            following the stone wall which leads to the bottom of the beat. It
            is a long walk, more than 2 kilometers over rough ground.

            Good dry fly fishing can be had from this little stream. 'Fish the

            The River Egg is a tiny violent stream that tumbles into the Walkham
            and was once used to provide domestic electricity and the remains of
            the small generating station can still be seen. From here downstream
            there is a series of pots, pools and runs down to Huckworthy. It
            includes Eggworthy Weir, a superb long pool that often holds good
            shoals of sea trout from May. Access at Huckworthy Bridge is through
            the drive of Huckworthy Mill. Please make yourself know to the

            effectively for sea trout from a stand at the neck of the pool.
            There are good runs adjacent to the old Wheal George Mine. Oak Tree
            pool, on the bend below Sargent&apos;s Weir, is also a good pool.

            This can be a very productive beat but its ease of access makes it a
            popular spot for picnics and dog walking. Expect to be disturbed on
            sunny summer weekends. It is best fished early in the morning or on
            wet days. When the river rises with autumn rain it is very popular
            with salmon fishermen. Expect salmon in high flows, sea trout run
            through and can be caught at night in the lower pools. The run into
            Pawsons Pool at Grenofen Bridge is a popular night fishing stand.
            Remain well upstream of the bridge and fish the run down to bridge.
            Casting down under the bridge can be counter productive. The beat
            has some history and most of the pools have been named.
