          <p>
            Single left bank fishing begins at the hedge immediately below
            Bertha Pool. Bertha Clam is the first pool. The pool is at the site
            of an old footbridge and the cables are still visible. It looks
            insignificant but produced a 23lb salmon in recent years. The beat
            continues for 0.6 kilometers and ends 30 meters above Ludbrook Weir.
          </p>
          <p>
            Access is from the single track roads from Fairtown or Coppice Town
            and down the tarmac track to Hatch Mill. Parking is possible just
            above the gate to Hatchmill either in the unused, overgrown gateway
            or in the layby created for this purpose. Please do not park at
            Hatchmill and do not obstruct access to the property. Please keep
            dogs on leads as poultry are often on the footpath leading through
            the yard and beyond. The upper section of the beat is accessed from
            the first field gate on your left walking back up the hill from the
            car park. An alternative route is via a steep path through the wood.
            The access to the path is just above the car park but is often
            obscured by summer growth. Please take extreme care if using this
            route as the path is very steep and slippery. It is impossible to
            pass directly from Hatch Mill Pool to Anderton Weir and vice versa,
            with any safety. All members are advised to make the short detour
            described above.

              Beat 5 is only available to Full Members and Associate Members, it
              is Reserved Water. Full Members can fish at any time, Associate

          <p>
            The 2.6 kilometers of fishing is double banked. The beat starts
            below the boundary wall of Buckland Abbey, National Trust, about 500
            meters below Denham Bridge. It ends at Lopwell Dam. There are two
            access gates to the left bank. One is on the bend below Denham and
            cars may be driven about 600 meters to a junction with another
            track. Driving beyond here is difficult but there is room to park
            two cars. The top track is accessed through a gate about 600 yards
            back up the hill to Crapstone. Parking for a number of cars can be
            found inside the gate and a number of places along the track, there
            is a turning circle at the end of the track.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The top track is in a better condition than the lower track but this
            can change with the weather and its use by forestry vehicles which
            churn up the surface. Please use the tracks with extreme care.
